# zeroflag.Threading Summary

= What is zeroflag.Threading? =
*zeroflag.Threading* (or just *zeroThread*) is a small library for data-parallelism similar (but much more basic) to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_FX_Library ParallelFX].


= Ah, right. And what is this supposed to look like for the user? =
Well, you could have a look at [ThreadingExample some examples]...


= How does it work? =
zeroThread is currently using the default System.Threading.ThreadPool provided by .NET/mono to queue up tasks. It's using Semaphores and Interlocked counters for synchronziation.


= And you're happy with that? =
I'm never happy! :P

Ultimate goal is to implement a much more powerful and cleaner ThreadPool (though, not as powerful as SAGE's) along with tools to reduce/remove locking for task-synchronization.

Instead, the (lockless) message queues used in [http://zeroflag.de/index.php?title=Concept SAGE] will be used to synchronize running tasks and queue up new tasks.
